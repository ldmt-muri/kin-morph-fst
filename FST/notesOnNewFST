Notes on possible weaknesses and inaccuracies of the FST:
    -The FST only allows for 3 objects and 4 applicative endings per verb. It would be easy to add more, however.
    -There are some grammatical features which are uncertain to me because of limited resources about Kinyarwanda:
        -It may be possible to have a perfect verb with no tense marker (as is possible for imperfect, present habitual)
        -I am not at all sure whether conditional verbs and defective verbs are treated correctly.
        -Imperatives: After looking at a lot of example Kinyarwanda text, I believe that the imperative form of a verb
          is just the infinitive minus the ku- or gu- prefix. However, this has not been added to the FST because I 
          found no resources to back this up.
        -Some verb morphemes are only attested in one of my sources (Kimenyi's Relational Grammar of Kinyarwanda).
          These features include: the ni- conditional prefix, the ta- conditional negative prefix,
          and the na- morpheme for also
          
An excellent resource for info about the language is the reference section in kinyarwanda.net
